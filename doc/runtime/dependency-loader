1. Abstract

  The runtime must be able to load external dependencies. The dependency loader
  implements this functionality for the runtime.

2. Dependency Resolution Protocol

  The dependency resolution protocol gives access to information about
  available libraries, library versions, interface files and the binary blob.


  2.1. Available Libraries

    A list of all available libraries must be accessible.

    Path:        /dependency/libraries
    Return-Type: [String]


  2.2. Available Versions of a Library

    A list of available versions of a library must be accessible.

    Path:        /dependency/{library}/versions
    Parameters:
      library:   The name of a library.
    Return-Type: [Version]

  2.3. Interface File

    An interface file of a specific library version must be accessible.

    Path:        /dependency/{library}/{version}/interface
    Parameters:
      library:   The name of a library.
      version:   The version of a library
    Return-Type: Interface


  2.4. Binary Blob

    The binary blob of a library must be accessible

3. Dependency Resolver

  A dependency resolver implements the dependency resolution protocol. It is a
  standalone application serving all kinds of libraries to a runtime.
